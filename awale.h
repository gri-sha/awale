/*
 * AWALE GAME (also known as Oware, Wari, or Mancala)
 * 
 * RULES:
 * 1. The board has 12 pits (6 per player) and each pit starts with 4 seeds
 * 2. Players alternate turns, selecting a pit on their side
 * 3. Seeds from the selected pit are sown counter-clockwise, one per pit
 * 4. The starting pit is left empty (seeds are distributed to following pits) (the case when seeds >= 12)
 * 5. CAPTURING: After sowing, if the last seed lands in an opponent's pit
 *    and that pit now has 2 or 3 seeds, those seeds are captured
 * 6. Continue capturing backwards if previous pits also have 2 or 3 seeds (previous numerically, if we skipped the starting pit it will be stopped at starting pit)
 * 7. You cannot capture all opponent's seeds (must leave them with a move)
 * 8. If opponent has no seeds, you must give them seeds if possible (if it not possible player having the seeds takes all the seeds)
 * 9. Game ends when one player captures 25+ seeds or no more moves possible
 * 10. Player with most seeds wins
